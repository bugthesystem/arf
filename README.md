> _This crate is developed to be part of Λ.R.Ξ.N.Λ 2D game engine._

> _The crate is named after a mathematician Cahit Arf. He is known for the Arf invariant of a quadratic form
> in characteristic 2 (applied in knot theory and surgery theory) in topology, the Hasse–Arf theorem
> in ramification theory, Arf semigroups, and Arf rings._
